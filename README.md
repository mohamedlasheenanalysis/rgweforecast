# X‑Minutal Analysis (Standalone App)

This repo contains a single-file web app (`index.html`) for the X‑Minutal Analysis dashboard.
Everything (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) is embedded into this one file — no external assets required.

## How to run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo.
2. Upload `index.html` (and this `README.md` if you like).
3. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**.
4. Choose **Deploy from a branch** and select the **main** branch root (`/`).
5. Save. Your site will be available at the Pages URL.

> Notes:
> - The app is fully self‑contained; no additional files are needed.
> - If you want to change the default PDF filename, search in `index.html` for `XMinutal_Report.pdf` and replace with your preferred name (e.g., `WTGs that exceed the max limits.pdf`).
